# riddler_5.26.18

## Express

I created four different sets of traps to test against: uniform distribution, multiples of 5, multiples of 10 and multiples of 25. Each possible percentage (1-99) was tested against each set, 10,000 simulations per point. Successes were summed across all sets.

This resulted in an optimal trap effectiveness of 49, 59 or 69. I chose 47 because I believe my model underestimated how many people would choose 50 (as well as 48 and 49, because I'm sure many will also predict the largest spike at 50).
