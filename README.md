# riddler_5.26.18

## Express

I created four different sets of traps to test against: uniform, multiples of 5, multiples of 10 and multiples of 25. I tested each possible percentage (1-99) against each set, 10,000 simulations per point. I then summed successes across all four sets.

This resulted in optimal trap percentages of 49 and 69. I chose 47 because I believe my model underestimated how many people would choose 50 (as well as 48 and 49 because they made the same assumption).
